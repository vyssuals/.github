# Welcome to Vyssuals
This is the organization page for the Vyssuals open source project.

## The Challenge
The currently available data visualisation tools are too complex and not well integrated into the day-to-day workflow of planners. It takes multiple export and import steps as well as expert knowledge in business intelligence software to get from BIM model to data visualisation. And even when that tedious process is completed, the connection to the model has been lost. The loop says open, we are at the end of a one-way-street.
## The Solution
Vyssuals.com is a data visualisation web application that can be connected to any data source. This can be a BIM model in any authoring software, local csv data or any web api. When connected to for example Revit, its 3d view is used to colour elements according to the visualisation created in the web app. This means it is easy to make sense of the charts in the context of your 3d model. And you donâ€™t even have to learn new software!
