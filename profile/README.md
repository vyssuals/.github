## The Challenge
The currently available data visualization tools are too complex and not well integrated into the day-to-day workflow of planners. It requires multiple export and import steps, as well as expert knowledge in business intelligence software, to transition from a BIM model to data visualization. Even after completing this tedious process, the connection to the model is lost. The loop remains open; we find ourselves at the end of a one-way street.
## The Solution
[Vyssuals.com](https://vyssuals.com) is a data visualization web application that can connect to any data source, including a BIM model from any authoring software, local CSV data, or any web API. When connected, for example, to Revit, its 3D view is utilized to color elements according to the visualization created in the web app. This simplifies understanding the charts within the context of your 3D model, eliminating the need to learn new software.
